# Answers to practical exercises


## Data Wrangling

Using the `frog-eyes-raw-data.csv` data and R, create a new dataframe that contains only the columns `genus_species`, `Family`, and two new columns containing the *species mean values* for `rootmass` and `eyemean`. Note that we will talk more about this dataset in later exercises, but it comes from (Thomas et al 2020 ADD CITATION)

There are multiple ways of doing this, but the easiest is as follows:
```{r}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)

# Read in the data
frog <- read_csv("data/frog-eyes-raw-data.csv")
# Take a look at it
glimpse(frog)

# Create a new dataframe called frog2
frog2 <-
  # Start with the frog dataframe
  frog %>%
  # Select only the columns of interest
  select(genus_species, Family, rootmass, eyemean) %>%
  # Group by species name, and Family (or summarise will try and average this too!)
  group_by(genus_species, Family) %>%
  # Summarise to get the mean values
  summarise(mean_rootmass = mean(rootmass),
            mean_eyemean = mean(eyemean))

# Look at frog2
glimpse(frog2)

# Write to file
# This is commented out as I don't want to save this
# write_csv(frog2, path = "data/clean-frog-data.csv")
```
