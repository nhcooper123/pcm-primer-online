# Common mistakes using PCMs in R

Throughout these exercises I've tried to mention common mistakes you might come across when working with your own data. I've collated some of them here 

## What to do if your code does not run

1. Run through everything

Restart R studio


## Common errors and how to fix them

### Standard R issues

1. Typos.

2. Incorrectly spelled variable names

3. Missing brackets, parentheses, commas, quotation marks.

4. The dreaded `+`

5. Cannot find `name of function`

6. Cannot find the dataset
  - unzipped
  - in the right place?
  
### Issues with the tree or data



### More specific PCM issues

- is the data a data frame?
- have you added row names as species names, and do they match the tree?
- optim errors
