# Preface {-}

The material in this online book is designed to support the *Primer on Phylogenetic Comparative Methods*. For more theoretical underpinnings of the topics covered here please refer to the Primer.

## Boxes {-}

Throughout the book are boxes of text highlighting particularly important issues:

```{block, type="info"}
**Information** Extra information about how the method or code works for those who are interested. These boxes may also show you how to solve problems that may not affect every user.
```

```{block, type="warning"}
**Warning** These boxes highlight important points that need to be considered when working through your own analyses. The image used here is a Jurassic Park era velociraptor to remind you of the "Jurassic Park caveat", i.e. that just because you *can* perform an analysis in R doesn't mean that you *should*. Always consider the question at hand, your study group, and the quality of the data you are using before embarking on a new comparative analyses.
```
